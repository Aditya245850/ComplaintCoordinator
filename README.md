Welcome to Complaint Coorinator!

Complaint Coordinator is a multi-modal complaint organization system developed using Python and Flask. 
This application leverages Google Cloud APIs to analyze and categorize various formats of complaints—voice, image, and video—while using OpenAI for 
processing and categorizing text-based complaints. The system provides a comprehensive interface for users to upload complaints in different formats 
and receive detailed categorizations and sentiment analysis. It also supports generating downloadable reports that include Plotly graphs for prioritizing 
complaints, streamlining the workflow for customer service teams.
